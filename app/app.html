     <p>
      This is an implementation
      of <a href="https://class.coursera.org/modelthinking/lecture/16">Schelling's
      spatial segregation model</a>. Schelling's model is agent-based; the
      agents represent two groups choosing residential locations. Each agent decides
      whether it is happy or unhappy in a neighborhood based on
      whether its neighbors are like it or not.</p>

      <p>
      <strong>Intolerance</strong> is a percentage of un-like neighbors above which the agent will become unhappy. For
      instance, if the intolerance is 25% and 2 out of 8 neighbors are
      like the agent, the agent will be happy. However, if the
      intolerance is 35%, the agent will not be happy and will move.
      Dots with red borders are unhappy.
     </p>

     <p>
       What is interesting about the model is that, even with a
       relatively low threshold, say 30%, extreme segregation
       results. Thus, fairly tolerant agents end up in segregated
       neighborhoods despite a tolerance for diversity.
     </p>

     <p>
       <strong>Fill</strong> factor
       determines what percentage of grid cells are occupied; for
       instance, a 95% fill factor leaves 5% of the cells vacant. The
       grid size simply determines how large the simulation grid
       is. The balance slider determines the balance between members
       of one group and members of another; if set to 50% there will
       be the same number of group1 and group2 agents.
